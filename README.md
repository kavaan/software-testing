# 14 Software Testing Approaches!
If we consider the stages of software development as akin to cooking a meal, the software testing domain can be likened to the moment when a chef tastes the dish after it's been prepared or during the cooking process. If the food lacks the right taste, color, or aroma the chef doesn't serve it to the consumer. In the world of software, the importance of software testing is such that practically no software can be released without undergoing various types of tests.
